TrinityCMS is a very old Custom-Made CMS I tried to create.
It has been rebuilt many times and integrated in various Frameworks like CodeIgniter and Laravel.

The latest open project of TrinityCMS is AquaFlameCMS.
I have quit working on this project or any project related to this one.

I might help AquaFlameCMS sometimes if needed.
Have a good day,
Adriann
